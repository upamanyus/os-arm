= Pre-emptive multiprocessing
[*] set up exception handlers.
[ ] save process state on exception.
[ ] Virtual memory. Test by having two kernel procs use same virtual addresses.
[ ] load (ELF) programs.
[ ] save user process state on per-process trapframe.
[ ] run user programs, with cooperative multithreading.
[ ] run timer, sample handler that just printf's or some such.

= Memory
* Declare memory map
* Kernel allocator
* Page allocator
= Filesystem
* Implement some super-basic filesystem (FAT?).
= Multiprocessing
* Want some syscalls, like
  - clone/fork/exec (for linux compat)
  - spawn (because it's nicer)
* elf support
* kmain() will execute "init" process, whatever that is.
= Graphics
* allocate framebuffer (via mailbox)
* abstraction layer about fb?
* fb console
