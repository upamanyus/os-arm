= Memory
* Declare memory map
* Kernel allocator
* Page allocator
= Filesystem
* Implement some super-basic filesystem (FAT?).
= Multiprocessing
* Want some syscalls, like
  - clone/fork/exec (for linux compat)
  - spawn (because it's nicer)
* elf support
* kmain() will execute "init" process, whatever that is.
= Graphics
* allocate framebuffer (via mailbox)
* abstraction layer about fb?
* fb console
