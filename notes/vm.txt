One strangeness of armv7 is that top-level page table is 16K, but second level
is 1K. 1K is less than a single page.

= Plan:
First, need to be able to allocate 16K chunks of physical memory.

Entries 0, 1, 2, 3 in top-level page table map to 4 second level pages all
within 1 physical page.

= Algorithm

Pages are 4KB.
4K entries in top-level table. 16KB
256 entries in each second-level table. 1KB.

Entries 0,1,2,3 in the top-level table map to (Base0,Base0+1K,Base0+2K,Base0+3K)
for some physical page starting at Base0.

Bottom 12 bits of virtual address (va) are only used at the very end to index
into page.
Say the upper 20bits of the va are given by
  `abcd efgh ijkl mnop qrst`.
We use the upper 12 bits `ab...kl` as the index into the first table.
We use the next 8 bits `mn...st` as the index in to the second table.

vm_map(va, pa):
- If no top-level pte for va, then create a 2nd level tables for va and its neighbors.
  + To create 2nd level tables: Allocate a physical page. Put entries in the
    top-level table at (i0 := INDEX1(va) & 0b1111_1111_1100) (which is 0xFFC), and at
    i1=i0+1, i2=i0+2, i3=i0+3.
- Get base of 2nd level table for va.
- Check if the entry at INDEX2(va) is valid. If it is, then panic.
- Otherwise, put in a pte pointing at pa.

= When and how to turn on MMU?
ARM's advice is "Therefore, ARM strongly recommends that any code that enables
or disables the MMU has identical virtual and physical addresses."

Solution:
put as the last page in memory a "trampoline", which is where all page-table
switches will happen.

Initial kernel page table will identity map the kernel code. It will also map a
"trampoline" page which contains the trampoline code, which is where page tables
are switched as a process returns to user mode from an exception.
