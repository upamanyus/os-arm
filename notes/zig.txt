Problems/annoyances with Zig:

= External symbols
This code is OK:
```
pub extern var __kern_end: [*]u8;
fn foo void {
    @ptrToInt(&__kern_end);
}
```
But this isn't:
```
pub extern var __kern_end: [*]u8;
pub var kern_end = &__kern_end; // BAD
pub var kern_end = @ptrToInt(&__kern_end); // BAD
```

This was seemingly somewhat fixed two years ago in
https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/5349

but then revereted due to failing tests, and never revisited.


= Function pointers

If we have
fn someF() void {
    std.log.info("someF ran\n", .{});
},
then &someF is NOT the location of the function.
E.g. if some assembly code is going to jump to an address, @ptrToInt(&someF) is
the wrong address. Instead, just @ptrToInt(someF) is the right one.

To be honest, I'm not even sure what &someF means. It kinda seems like an
expression like &&some_var.

fn callF(f: (*const fn () void)) void {
    std.log.info("fn = 0x{0x}", .{@ptrToInt(f)});
    std.log.info("fn = 0x{0x}", .{@ptrToInt(f.*)});
    (f.*)();
}

= Project-relative imports
Can't import files relative to the project's root.
Instead, have to type "../../arch/aarch64/util.zig"
