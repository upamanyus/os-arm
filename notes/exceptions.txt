Q: When an interrupt happens, where do we save the state of the currently
executing code (be it a user process, kernel process, etc.)?
A: One option is to put it on the stack.
That's what

does.

Linux seems to make sure that overflow doesn't happen:

In arm32, How does linux read the usr-banked SP and LR registers?
Does it also still set up SP_irq by reading from memory, or does it set SP_irq
before switching to a process?

Note when reading linux source: swi == svc
arch/arm/kernel/entry-common.S:157 has the syscall exception handler.
Note that it just writes stuff to the top of the stack!
Also note: saves the user SP+LR by using
  stmdb r8, {sp, lr}^
or by using
  kernel/entry-header.S:178

Q: what is ARM_ORIG_r0?

This means that Linux must be setting up SP_svc/SP_swi to point to a special
kernel stack. Question: how+where does it do that?
When a task is spawned


What xv6 does:
before turning on interrupts, it saves a pointer to a trapframe in sscratch.
sscratch could point to a trapframe for the CPU that the process is currently
executing on. xv6 gives each process its own trapframe, which serves to hold the
register state for pre-empted processes.

One question: is there a vector that can only be accessed in EL1?

rpi-zero has ARM1176JZF, which seems to support vbar to set offset for vector table.

My plan:
Have a per-CPU current trap frame.
Each kproc has its own trap frame.
When switching to a kproc, we set the current trap frame to that kproc's trap
frame.

Have a (per-CPU) *kernel* trap-frame. It's where stuff is written when
When running in kernel mode, set

In arm32, there's a banked register for fiq, irq, svc, undef, and abort.

In any given moment, the correct stack has to be set.
We'll always be running either a specified kproc (with its own stack), or the
"initial" kproc which runs the scheduler.

Initially, IRQs are disabled, and there should be no exceptions.

The boot code should set up an exception frame.


Exception occurs. Interrupts are disabled by hardware.
Save registers to the current exception frame.
Q: What happens if we now turn on exceptions?
A: If e.g. a timer interrupt fires (or maybe an inter-process interrupt) while
in the kernel. Well, in order for this interrupt to fire, we must be executing
in "usr" mode, so we're using the SP_usr register, and the interrupt can simply
switch to SP_irq.

When doing a switch from one proc to another.

CPSR before triggering svc:

After:

Linux has to set up SP_<mode> somewhere, because with no setup, it defaults to 0
